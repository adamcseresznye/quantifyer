Quantifyer
==============================

Quantifyer is a software application designed to simplify and streamline data analysis for targeted mass-based LC/GC-MS applications. It enables users to quickly and accurately calculate key metrics, such as **recovery**, **correction factor**, and **concentration** values. While originally designed for environmental sciences, Quantifyer’s versatility extends to other fields that utilize mass-based quantitations. The application also generates informative plots that support informed decision-making and expedite turnaround times.

You can access the project’s app through its [Streamlit website](https://quantifyer.streamlit.app/) and the corresponding article describing the project is available [here](https://adamcseresznye.github.io/blog/projects/Quantifyer/quantifyer.html).

As of 2024-01-15, Quantifyer's unit test coverage is **94%** (coverage.py v7.4.0).
