    **What** : Quantifyer streamlines the data analysis process for targeted LC/GC-MS applications, enabling rapid calculation of key metrics like recovery,
    correction factor, and concentration values. Additionally, it provides informative plots.
    **Why** :  Manually calculating metrics in Excel can be a tedious and error-prone process, often leading to inconsistencies due to copy-paste errors
    and repetitive operations. Quantifyer eliminates these challenges by automating the calculations, ensuring accuracy and reproducibility.
    Additionally, its rapid processing speed significantly reduces turnaround time, compared to manual quantitation.
    **How** : The Quantifyer app requires only three simple input files: a file containing concentrations and peak areas for each analyte in the samples,
      a file indicating whether each sample is a blank, QC, sample, or standard mix, and a file specifying which analyte is quantitated by which internal standard. See below.

    Quantifyer requires three mandatory input files:
    * Quantitative data file (CSV/Excel): This file contains peak area and concentration data for each analyte in the samples.
    * Internal standard correspondence file (CSV/Excel): This file specifies which analyte is quantitated by which internal standard and the reconstitution standard used.
    * Sample properties file (CSV/Excel): This file categorizes each sample as blank, QC, sample, or standard, and indicates the extraction volume (mL).

    The app also accepts two optional input files:
    * QC file (CSV/Excel): This file is optional and contains the measured QC concentration for each analyte. If not provided, all analytes will have a correction factor of 1, indicating no correction is applied. This file is used exclusively for calculating correction factors.
    * Spike file (CSV/Excel): This optional file contains the amount of internal standard and reconstitution standard spiked in each sample (in pg). It is used only for calculating recoveries.
